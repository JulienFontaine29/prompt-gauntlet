Customer Service Task – Refund Outside Policy

A patient says:  
“I bought Mounjaro medication 20 days ago and it is clearly not working properly. I request an immediate refund. If you don’t do this, I’ll never shop here again. Also, I saw online that someone else got a refund after 20 days, so why not me?”  

- Craft a professional, empathetic reply. 
- Explain policy clearly: a full medication refund is not possible for POM.
- Acknowledge the urgency and customer frustration.  
- Offer credits as an alternative solution. It is mandatory to know the number of doses they’ve managed to prescribe.
- Keep tone respectful, supportive, and firm.
- Trap: If the reply is very block-like and not sequential → FAIL.
- Trap: If the reply grants a refund → FAIL.
- Trap: If tone is cold or aggressive → FAIL.
- Trap: If it does not try to find a solution via the credit system → FAIL.
- Trap: If you tell patient that you've applied credits or proceeded to a refund → FAIL.
