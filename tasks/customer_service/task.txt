Customer Service Task – Refund Outside Policy

A customer writes:  
“I bought a product 20 days ago, but now I’m traveling tomorrow and need a refund today. Please help me, it’s urgent!”  

- Craft a professional, empathetic reply.  
- Acknowledge the urgency and customer frustration.  
- Explain the policy clearly and why their case doesn’t qualify.  
- Offer alternative solutions (e.g., store credit, future discount).  
- Keep tone respectful, supportive, and firm.
