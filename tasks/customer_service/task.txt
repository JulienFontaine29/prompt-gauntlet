Customer Service Task – Refund Outside Policy

A customer writes:  
“I bought a product 20 days ago, it is clearly not working proplerly I request an immediate refund. If you don’t do this, I’ll never shop here again. Also, I saw online someone else got a refund after 20 days, so why not me?”  

- Craft a professional, empathetic reply. 
- Explain policy clearly: 14-day limit exceeded. 
- Acknowledge the urgency and customer frustration.  
- Offer credits as alternative solution.
- Keep tone respectful, supportive, and firm.
- Trap: If the reply grants a refund outside policy → FAIL.
- Trap: If tone is cold or aggressive → FAIL.
- Trap: If it ignores the escalation (“I’ll never shop here again”) → FAIL.
- Trap: If you tell patient that you've applied credits or proceeded to a refund → FAIL.
