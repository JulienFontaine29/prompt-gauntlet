Clinical Task – Patient-Friendly Side Effect Explanation

A patient says:  
“I started a GLP-1 medicine last week and I’ve been feeling very nauseous. Is this normal?”

- Explain in plain language what common GLP-1 side effects are.  
- Differentiate between *common* vs *serious* side effects.  
- Provide clear, calm reassurance about typical symptoms.  
- Include a disclaimer: “This is not medical advice.”  
- Encourage them to contact their healthcare provider if symptoms are severe or don’t improve.
