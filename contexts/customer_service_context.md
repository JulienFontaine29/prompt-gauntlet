# Customer Service Context – Refund Policy

- Refunds allowed: within 14 days of purchase, product unused, with receipt.  
- No refunds: digital downloads, products on clearance, items beyond 14 days.  
- Exceptions require manager approval.  
- Customers often cite urgency (e.g., “leaving on holiday tomorrow”) — but policy still applies.  
- Tone must be professional, empathetic, but firm.  
- Encourage alternatives: store credit, exchanges, discounts on next order.  
- Out-of-scope: Promising refunds outside policy, changing legal terms.
